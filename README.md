## About This Repository

This repository is where HTML5-Boilerplate is authored. Some of the tools,
files and processes that you see here are solely for the _production_ of
HTML5 Boilerplate and are not _part_ of HTML5 Boilerplate. For one example, the
[gulpfile.mjs](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/main/gulpfile.mjs)
script is used to _build_ the project. It's not part of the project itself.

## Quick Start

Choose one of the following options:

- Using the [create-html5-boilerplate](https://github.com/ashu-30781/Boilerplate-Html-css-js)
  script, instantly fetch the latest npm published package (or any version
  available on npm) with `npx`, `npm init` or `yarn create` without having to
  install any dependencies. Running the following `npx` command installs the
  latest version into a folder called `new-site`

  ```bash
  npx create-html5-boilerplate new-site
  cd new-site
  npm install
  npm run start
  ```



- Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install html5-boilerplate`
  or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): `yarn add html5-boilerplate`. The resulting
  `node_modules/html5-boilerplate/dist` folder represents the latest version of
  the project for end users. Depending on what you want to use and how you want
  to use it, you may have to copy and paste the contents of that folder into
  your project directory.
